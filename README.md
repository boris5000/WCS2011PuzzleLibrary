# WCS2011PuzzleLibrary
A collection of Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Puzzles


## Organization

In lieu of the puzzle download mechanic working correctly on the spoofed-DNS WFC either through melonDS or physical hardware I have decided to start a collection of user-contributed puzzles.


To make things easier, giving the sav an arbitrary name e.g. `puzzles.sav` will let users rename their legitimately obtained nds file to match the sav file or vice versa so the puzzles can be enjoyed readily. For example, I make all my puzzles on a nds file called `puzzles.nds` and the `puzzles.sav` file is in the same folder and I can easily upload the save file without much quibble


## Contributing
By far the easiest way to contribute is to make a fork of this repository and then add your .sav file with your puzzles in it to a directory named after your github username. And then make a pull request to have your save added to the library.

If you want to add more puzzles in the future you can then update your .sav file and make another pull request whenever you would like. 

To help fellow puzzlers you can also provide a brief description of the puzzles with hints on how to solve them or even provide the solutions.

See the example in `puzzles/boris5000`
